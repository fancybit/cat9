## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Background

Global game market revenue and virtual commodity trading scale continue to expand, with self-media social network user scale exceeding 5 billion. The massive digital content and transaction data make the demand for secure storage and efficient access increasingly urgent. Traditional centralized systems have defects such as single point of failure, data tampering, high storage costs, and large access delays, while single blockchain networks face low storage efficiency, high time-space complexity (exponential growth in some scenarios), and difficulty in balancing security and efficiency, making it difficult to meet the application needs of large-scale digital scenarios.

The decentralization and immutability characteristics of blockchain provide technical support for information security. The social connection advantages of Six Degrees Principle can optimize network topology. The distributed storage architecture of IPFS can solve data storage efficiency problems. The dynamic adjustment of node mutual trust consensus depth can achieve flexible adaptation of security and efficiency. The integration of these four technologies is expected to break through traditional system bottlenecks and build a new network ecosystem with security, trustworthiness, efficient storage, and dynamic balance capabilities.

### 1.2 Research Significance

**Theoretical Significance**: For the first time, systematically integrate blockchain, Six Degrees Principle, IPFS, and dynamic mutual trust consensus mechanism, propose the Metajade Block Network construction framework, enrich information security and distributed network theory, and provide new perspectives for interdisciplinary research.

**Practical Significance**: Address security and storage pain points in game distribution and other scenarios, realize transaction traceability, copyright protection, and efficient storage, achieve efficiency and security balance through consensus depth adjustment mechanism; the scalable architecture lays the foundation for promotion in pan-trading and social fields, helping the healthy development of the digital economy.

### 1.3 Research Content and Framework

This paper sorts out relevant theories and technical foundations, constructs the Metajade Block Network architecture (integrating IPFS and dynamic consensus mechanism), analyzes its applications in game distribution and virtual commodity sales, explores promotion paths, and compares its time-space complexity differences with traditional blockchain networks through tables.

## 2. Related Theories and Technical Foundations

### 2.1 Blockchain Technology

Blockchain is a distributed ledger maintained by multiple nodes, with core characteristics including decentralization, immutability, full traceability, and automatic execution of smart contracts. However, single blockchain networks have problems such as high storage redundancy, low data access efficiency, high time-space complexity (transaction confirmation time complexity reaches O(n²) or even exponential growth under some consensus mechanisms), and fixed consensus depth making it difficult to balance security and efficiency, limiting large-scale applications.

### 2.2 Six Degrees Principle

The Six Degrees Principle reveals the law that "any two people can establish connections through no more than six intermediaries." Networks built based on this principle have advantages such as high connectivity, resistance to single point failure, and efficient trust transmission, which can optimize node connection logic, reduce network path length from linear or exponential to logarithmic level, and improve network data transmission efficiency.

### 2.3 IPFS Technology

IPFS is a distributed file system that replaces traditional HTTP location addressing with content addressing. Files are divided according to adaptive block strategies (dynamically adjusting block size based on file size, rather than fixed 256KB) and distributedly stored in nodes, using hash values to uniquely identify files, achieving efficient data retrieval and redundant storage optimization, effectively reducing storage costs and access delays.

### 2.4 Node Mutual Trust Consensus Depth Theory

Node mutual trust consensus depth refers to the node hierarchy participating in consensus on transactions or data in the network and the data traceability depth. The deeper the consensus depth, the more node layers participating in verification and the more complete the traceability data, the higher the security, but the longer the consensus time and the lower the efficiency; conversely, the shallower the consensus depth, the higher the efficiency, but the relatively lower security. Dynamic adjustment of consensus depth can achieve precise adaptation of efficiency and security in different scenarios.

### 2.5 Feasibility of Multi-technology Integration

Blockchain provides trustworthy support for Six Degrees Principle, IPFS, and consensus mechanisms; Six Degrees Principle optimizes node connection efficiency; IPFS solves storage bottlenecks; dynamic consensus depth mechanism balances security and efficiency. The four form a collaborative system of "trustworthy guarantee + efficient connection + optimized storage + dynamic balance," providing feasibility for Metajade Block Network construction.

## 3. Construction Framework of Metajade Block Network

### 3.1 Network Core Objectives

With "security and trustworthiness, efficient storage, dynamic balance, scalable evolution" as core objectives: 1. Data Security: Ensure encrypted storage and immutability of transaction and privacy data; 2. Efficient Storage: Optimize storage architecture based on IPFS, reduce costs and access delays; 3. Dynamic Balance: Achieve adaptive adaptation of efficiency and security through consensus depth adjustment mechanism; 4. Ecological Expansion: Support multi-scenario access and achieve cross-domain collaboration.

### 3.2 Overall Architecture Design

The Metajade Block Network adopts a "four-layer collaborative architecture," including **underlying storage layer, core technology layer, network connection layer, and scenario application layer**, with each layer collaborating to achieve secure, efficient, and dynamically balanced network functions.

**Underlying Storage Layer**: With IPFS as the core, responsible for distributed storage of massive data. Using IPFS adaptive block strategy, generating unique content hash values based on file size (such as direct storage for small files, dynamic segmentation for large files into blocks ranging from tens of KB to several MB) and storing them in IPFS distributed node clusters; optimizing node distribution through Six Degrees Principle, building a storage topology of "nearby access + multi-path backup," reducing cross-node data transmission distance, while reducing redundant storage ratio (compared with traditional blockchain storage, redundancy reduced from n times to logn times); adopting a "hot data local cache + cold data distributed archiving" strategy to further improve data access efficiency.

**Core Technology Layer**: With blockchain technology as the core, integrating cryptographic algorithms, smart contracts, and **dynamic mutual trust consensus depth adjustment mechanism**. Adopting hybrid chain architecture (consortium chain + public chain), with the consortium chain responsible for core transaction logic and permission management, and the public chain ensuring data public traceability; achieving user identity anonymity and data encrypted transmission through asymmetric encryption; smart contracts implementing automatic transaction execution, copyright confirmation, and other functions, with large file data associated with contracts stored in IPFS, only storing file hash values and contract execution results on the blockchain, significantly reducing blockchain storage pressure; introducing consensus depth adjustment module, dynamically adjusting consensus participation hierarchy and data traceability depth based on transaction importance, network load, etc.

**Network Connection Layer**: Building dynamic node networks based on Six Degrees Principle, covering users, game publishers, trading platforms, and other nodes. Nodes are dynamically connected according to "six-degree connection rules," forming a "small world" network topology, reducing the average path length between nodes from O(n) to O(logn); each node has a blockchain digital identity, with trust relationships quantitatively evaluated through transaction history and social connections; optimizing IPFS node routing algorithms and blockchain node consensus mechanisms using Six Degrees Principle, improving data transmission rate and consensus efficiency.

**Scenario Application Layer**: Providing application interfaces and functional modules for specific scenarios, initially focusing on game distribution and virtual commodity sales, subsequently expanding to pan-trading and self-media social fields. Including core modules such as user management, transaction traceability, copyright protection, and consensus depth configuration, supporting third-party applications to access through API interfaces.

### 3.3 Core Mechanism Design

**Identity Authentication and Permission Management**: Based on blockchain asymmetric encryption, assign unique digital identity certificates, combined with node trust ratings to achieve multi-dimensional permission control, ensuring data access security.

**Trust Transmission and Evaluation**: Quantitatively evaluate node trustworthiness through "direct trust + indirect trust," with trust ratings stored on-chain as the basis for transaction matching and consensus participation permissions.

**Smart Contract and IPFS Collaboration**: Smart contracts execute transaction logic, store large file data in IPFS, only storing file hash values and contract execution results on the blockchain, achieving "on-chain trustworthy + off-chain efficient storage."

**Data Security and Privacy Protection**: Adopt "encrypted storage + privacy computing" technology, with user privacy data encrypted and stored in IPFS, achieving data "verifiable but invisible" through zero-knowledge proof.

**Dynamic Mutual Trust Consensus Depth Adjustment Mechanism**:
- Trigger Conditions: Automatically trigger adjustments based on transaction amount (such as high-value virtual commodity transactions), data sensitivity (such as user core privacy data), and network load (such as peak transaction periods).
- Adjustment Logic: Increase consensus depth for high-value/sensitive transactions (such as tracing 3-5 layers of associated node transaction records, mobilizing 60%-80% of high-trust nodes to participate in verification); decrease consensus depth for ordinary transactions (such as tracing 1-2 layers of nodes, mobilizing 30%-50% of high-trust nodes to participate in verification); appropriately reduce consensus depth when network load is too high to ensure efficiency, and increase consensus depth when load is low to strengthen security.
- Balance Effect: Through this mechanism, the overall network transaction efficiency can be significantly improved while ensuring the security of core data, and the security protection level of core transactions can be further strengthened.

### 3.4 Time-Space Complexity Comparison

The Metajade Block Network reduces the high complexity of traditional blockchain networks (some exponential, polynomial) to logarithmic level through the integration of Six Degrees Principle, IPFS, and dynamic consensus mechanism, while achieving dynamic balance between efficiency and security. The following is the time-space complexity comparison with traditional blockchain networks:

| Indicator | Traditional Blockchain Network | Metajade Block Network | Complexity Level |
|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Time Complexity (Transaction Confirmation) | O(n²) (approaching O(2ⁿ) under some consensus mechanisms) | O(nlogn) (can be reduced to O(logn) under dynamic consensus) | Polynomial/Exponential → Logarithmic |
| Time Complexity (Data Retrieval) | O(n) (linear level) | O(logn) (logarithmic level) | Linear → Logarithmic |
| Space Complexity (Data Storage) | O(n×D) (n is number of nodes, D is total data) | O(D×logn) | Linear → Logarithmic |
| Node Connection Efficiency (Average Path Length) | O(n) (linear level) | O(logn) (logarithmic level) | Linear → Logarithmic |
| Security-Efficiency Balance (Relative Value) | Fixed (60) | Dynamically Adjustable (60-90) | - |

Note: Complexity levels are divided according to computer algorithm complexity standards; Security-efficiency balance is a relative evaluation value (100 is optimal), with traditional blockchain networks using fixed consensus depth and lower adjustable balance.

## 4. Application of Metajade Block Network in Game Distribution and Virtual Commodity Sales

### 4.1 Application Scheme in Game Distribution Scenarios

**Game Copyright Protection**: Game core resources (source code, art resources) are encrypted and stored in IPFS, generating unique hash values on-chain to form copyright certificates. Smart contracts set usage rules, third-party usage requires authorization, with authorization records and usage behaviors fully traceable on-chain; for core copyright data, automatically increase consensus depth to strengthen security protection.

**Game Distribution and Updates**: Game installation packages are stored in IPFS, using adaptive block strategies to optimize transmission efficiency. Users obtain download permissions through blockchain identity authentication, and quickly download using IPFS distributed nodes and six-degree optimized routing; update patches are synchronized to each node through IPFS, improving distribution efficiency; ordinary updates use shallow consensus depth to ensure speed, while core version updates increase consensus depth to ensure integrity.

**User Account Security**: User accounts are bound to blockchain digital identities, using multi-factor authentication + smart contract authorization mechanism, with account data hash values stored in IPFS; account login, asset transfer, and other operations dynamically adjust consensus depth based on risk level, with high-risk operations (such as large virtual asset transfers) increasing consensus depth to ensure account security.

### 4.2 Application Scheme in Virtual Commodity Sales Scenarios

**Virtual Commodity Rights Confirmation and Traceability**: When virtual commodities are issued, unique blockchain identifiers are generated, commodity data is stored in IPFS, and transaction transfer records are on-chain, forming complete traceability chains, eliminating forgery and theft.

**Transaction Security and Efficient Settlement**: Transactions are completed through smart contracts, with funds escrowed by contracts, and automatic payment after commodity ownership transfer; consensus depth is dynamically adjusted based on commodity value, with high-value commodities (such as rare game items) using deep consensus to ensure security, and ordinary commodities using shallow consensus to improve transaction speed; commodity resources are efficiently accessed through IPFS, improving transaction experience.

**Second-hand Trading Regulation**: Second-hand transactions verify commodity ownership through smart contracts, with transaction records on-chain, and automatic distribution of handling fees and copyright benefits according to rules; during the transaction process, consensus participation node hierarchy is dynamically adjusted based on transaction party trust ratings and commodity value, regulating market order while considering efficiency.
